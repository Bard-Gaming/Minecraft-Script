# Minecraft Script

Minecraft script is primarily a tool to make Minecraft Datapack creation easier.
Minecraft Script is an interpreted programming language which goes through the Python interpreter for output.
However, interpretation is not its main feature, and is rather more of a debugging tool, as its sole
purpose is to allow you to validate your code before building it into a full datapack.

## Installation
MCS can be installed using [Python's pip module](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```cmd
pip install minecraft-script
```
or
```cmd
python -m pip install minecraft-script
```
_Note: The package's name in pip is written with a hyphen ``-``,
whilst the actual Python package is written with an underscore ``_``._


## Usage
For a list of all shell commands, you can use the following command:
```cmd
python -m minecraft_script help
```
If you want to simplify the usage of shell commands, you can check out [the documentation](https://github.com/Bard-Gaming/Minecraft-Script/blob/main/documentation/installations.md).
